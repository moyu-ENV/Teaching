# Introduction
Storms have a significant impact on critical infrastructure, often causing widespread power outages. This lab focuses on investigating the relationship between storm characteristics, socio-economic factors, and electricity blackouts using insights from nightlight data.

Using real-world datasets such as **IBTrACS historical storm records** and **Black Marble satellite-based nighttime light observations**, along with a variety of machine learning and data visualization techniques, you will clean, process, and develop predictive models to better understand the factors contributing to these outages.
